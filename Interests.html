  <h2>"I like to see myself as a creative person."</h2>
  <h3>Although I am a chemical engineering undergraduate , I am into coding . I like to solve data structures and algorithms problems.
  Alongside I am also interested in machine learning .  I try to find time out to devote to web development. 
  I will also like to go for Android application development.</h3>

  <h3>Among hobbies, I like playing football, badminton . Like reading novels , mostly classic . Not an addict to web series or movies, but  
      find them entertaining as well.</h3>
  <h3>Yes, I also actively participate in college dramatics society . Love those impromptu and short plays which we would enact on stage and put in 
      hours of our precious time out of acad schedule towards the practice sessions.</h3>
